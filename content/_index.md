title: "Organ Transplantation in India"
---

India's low organ donation rates contribute to preventable deaths each year. Key information for doctors, patients, and policymakers is scattered across multiple websites or sometimes not published online at all.

This site collects useful resources in one place. It's a side project by an individual researcher—no promises about completeness or regular updates.

## What's Here

**Numbers and data sources**
Links to datasets from NOTTO, SOTTOs, state societies, and hospitals. 

**Policy questions** 
Notes on what affects successful transplantations: hospital capacity, trained specialists, legal frameworks, social attitudes, and physician incentives.

**How laws work in practice**
What intensivists actually worry about legally, and how transplantation regulations play out in ICUs.

**People working on this**
Researchers and clinicians studying organ transplantation policy in India.

## What's next

Here are essentials that we're missing:

- An analytical framework that goes through the transplantation process sequentially—from identifying potential donors to successful transplantation. We need to decide whether to tackle issues chronologically or focus on missing elements in the policy pipeline (datasets, research, proposals).

- A review paper with a coherent typology of the problems. The field lacks a systematic way to think about "hardware" problems (ICU capacity, specialists, cold-chain logistics) versus "software" problems (social attitudes, legal clarity, physician incentives).

- Better understanding of how doctors actually navigate legal risks. The existing literature on end-of-life attitudes among intensivists is limited and mostly based on members of professional societies.

The field needs better datasets, more research, clearer policy proposals, and stronger implementation capacity. This site tries to organize what exists so far.
