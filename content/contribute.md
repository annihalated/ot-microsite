This is a side project with no funding or staff. Contributions are welcome but I can't promise quick responses or that everything will be used.

## What Would Be Helpful

**Better data sources**
If you know of reliable organ transplantation datasets I've missed, especially from hospitals or state governments.

**Corrections**
Point out factual errors, broken links, or outdated information.

**Missing resources**
Key papers, reports, or websites that should be included.

**Ground-level insights**
How transplantation laws actually work in practice. What doctors worry about legally. Barriers patients face.

## How to Contribute

Email: [contributors@ot.nihalsahu.net]

Include:
- What you're contributing
- Your background (optional but helpful for context)
- Sources if relevant

## What I'll Do

I'll review contributions when I can and add useful material to the site. I may edit for brevity or clarity. No promises about timing or inclusion.

## Recognition

If you contribute something substantial, I'll add your name to an acknowledgments page unless you prefer otherwise.
