This project aims to resolve those anomalies and make brain death declaration legal and practicable.
We want brain death declaration to be legally valid, practically feasible, and socially accepted among doctors.

It is unclear whether “brain death” is death in all instances, or only for the purposes of organ transplantation.
it is unclear *how* deaths may be declared.
It is unclear *when* such deaths may be declared.
It is unclear what the *consequences* of such a declaration are.

As a consequence:

- Doctors are afraid to declare brain deaths.
- Family members are given false hope.
- Other patients are denied ventilators and other life sustaining treatment.
- Organ donation is less likely if brain death is not declared widely.

## Pipeline/Work plan

“We need to establish data sets, develop a research literature, incubate diverse policy proposals, debate them, develop a mature point of view on how the problems will be solved, present these choices to legislators, enact new laws, and then build the state capacity to enforce these laws.”

At each stage, publish intermediate research findings.

### **Data: establish a statistical system.**

*Collect facts systematically and accurately on all aspects of the topic in question.*

#### Broad questions

* What are the fundamental facts about death and brain death?
* How is death declared in India?
* What is the law of death declaration? What are state-level variations?
  * Study two or three states
* How does this tie in to a system of vital statistics?
* What are patients’ experiences of brain death declaration?
* What are doctors’ experiences of brain death declaration?
* What is the experience of the system of public administration in relation to brain death declaration?

#### Foundational information

* Desk research
* Consult with experts
  * Shubha Dole at TIFR

#### Qualitative data

* Interviews on family experience
* Interviews on doctor experiences
* Interviews on administrator experiences.

#### Quantitative data

* Number of brain death declarations by state and by district
* Total number of death declarations by state and by district

### **Research: conduct causal research.**

*Study the data, establish broad regularities and trends, explore causal connections.*

### **Proposals: explore new policy solutions.**

*Identify and analyse as many options as possible.*

### **Persuasion: engage in public debate.**

*Debate and discuss with a wide section of the community, explore alternatives, analyse possibilities, and move towards a consensus.*

### **Decisions: make political economy actions.**

*Bureaucrats and politicians discuss options and tradeoffs and make choices.*

### **Implementation I: convert policy into a legal instrument.**

*Translate the final policy decision into a legal instrument, a law.*  

### **Implementation II: create state capacity.**

*Create administrative structures within the government to ensure effective enforcement of the new law.*
